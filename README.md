# BuBO - Build graph Based Ontology
BuBO is a proof-of-concept OWL ontology made during the work for my Bachelor's thesis. The goal is to represent the dependencies of the Make (makefile) and Soong (blueprint) parts of the AOSP build system. It is not a complete model, but can easily be extended if need be. An example application of BuBO can be found in [storagemanager-example.rdf](storagemanager-example.rdf), or represented as a graph below:

## Viewing and editing
To edit the ontology and view it as a graph, I recommend using Protégé and its OntoGraf tool. Protégé is available at [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/). Otherwise, online visualization tools like [RDF Grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher) might be of interest.
